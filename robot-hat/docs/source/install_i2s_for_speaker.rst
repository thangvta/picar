Install ``i2samp.sh`` for the Speaker
==============================================

The ``i2samp.sh`` is a sophisticated Bash script specifically designed for setting up and configuring an I2S (Inter-IC Sound) amplifier on Raspberry Pi and similar devices. Licensed under the MIT license, it ensures compatibility with a range of hardware and operating systems, conducting thorough checks before proceeding with any installation or configuration.

If you want your speaker to work properly, you definitely need to install this script. 

The steps are as follows:

.. code-block::

    cd ~/robot-hat
    sudo bash i2samp.sh

Type ``y`` and press ``enter`` to continue running the script.

.. _pin_adc:

ADC
-------

.. image:: img/adcpin.png

The Robot HAT features four sets of 3Pin ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) pins, each spaced 2.54mm apart. These pins operate at a 3.3V power supply. The ADC function, offering 12-bit precision, is facilitated by an onboard microcontroller. Detailed instructions for reading ADC values are provided in the :ref:`on_board_mcu` section.

.. image:: img/btradc.png

Also, ADC channel A4 is connected to the battery through a voltage divider using resistors, 
which will be used to measure the battery voltage to estimate the approximate battery charge.

The voltage divider ratio is 20K/10K, so:

* A4 voltage (Va4) = value_A4 / 4095.0 * 3.3
* Battery voltage (Vbat) = Va4*3
* Battery voltage (Vbat) = value_A4 / 4095.0 * 3.3 * 3

The Robot HAT has two I2C interfaces. One is the P2.54 4-pin interface, and the other is the SH1.0 4-pin interface, which is compatible with QWIIC and STEMMA QT. 
These I2C interfaces are connected to the Raspberry Pi's I2C interface via GPIO2 (SDA) and GPIO3 (SCL). 
The board also features an :ref:`on_board_mcu`, and the two signal lines have 10K pull-up resistors.

The battery level indicator on the Robot HAT monitors the battery voltage using a voltage divider method and serves as a reference for estimating the battery level. 
The relationship between the LED and voltage is as follows:

.. list-table:: Battery Level
    :widths: 50 50

    * - LED Battery
      - Total Voltage
    * - 2 LEDs on
      - Greater than 7.6V
    * - 1 LED on
      - Greater than 7.15V
    * - Both LEDs off
      - Less than 7.15V

When any one of the batteries reaches or exceeds 4.1V while the others are below that threshold, 
the charging current of that specific battery will be reduced.

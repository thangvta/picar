Control Servos and Motors
============================

In this project, we have 12 servos and two motors working simultaneously.

However, it's important to note that if your servos and motors have a high starting current, it's recommended to start them separately to avoid insufficient power supply current, which could lead to the Raspberry Pi restarting.

**Code**

.. code-block:: python

    from robot_hat import Servo, Motors
    import time

    # Create objects for 12 servos
    servos = [Servo(f"P{i}") for i in range(12)]

    # Create motor object
    motors = Motors()

    def initialize_servos():
        """Set initial angle of all servos to 0."""
        for servo in servos:
            servo.angle(-90)
            time.sleep(0.1)  # Wait for servos to reach the initial position
        time.sleep(1)


    def sweep_servos(angle_from, angle_to, step):
        """Control all servos to sweep from a start angle to an end angle."""
        if angle_from < angle_to:
            range_func = range(angle_from, angle_to + 1, step)
        else:
            range_func = range(angle_from, angle_to - 1, -step)

        for angle in range_func:
            for servo in servos:
                servo.angle(angle)
            time.sleep(0.05)

    def control_motors_and_servos():
        """Control motors and servos in synchronization."""
        try:
            while True:
                # Motors rotate forward and servos sweep from -90 to 90 degrees
                motors[1].speed(80)
                time.sleep(0.01)
                motors[2].speed(80)
                time.sleep(0.01)
                sweep_servos(-90, 90, 5)
                time.sleep(1)

                # Motors rotate backward and servos sweep from 90 to -90 degrees
                motors[1].speed(-80)
                time.sleep(0.01)
                motors[2].speed(-80)
                time.sleep(0.01)
                sweep_servos(90, -90, 5)
                time.sleep(1)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            # Stop motors when Ctrl+C is pressed
            motors.stop()
            print("Motors stopped.")

    # Initialize servos to their initial position
    initialize_servos()

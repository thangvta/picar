DIY Car
==============

In addition to being suitable for simple experiments, the Robot HAT is ideal for use as a central controller in robotics, such as for smart cars.

In this project, we built a simple line-following car.

**Code**

.. code-block:: python

    from robot_hat import Motors, Pin
    import time

    # Create motor object
    motors = Motors()

    # Initialize line tracking sensor
    line_track = Pin('D0')

    def main():
        while True:
            # print("value", line_track.value())
            # time.sleep(0.01)
            if line_track.value() == 1:
                # If line is detected
                motors[1].speed(-60)  # Motor 1 forward
                motors[2].speed(20) # Motor 2 backward
                time.sleep(0.01)
            else:
                # If line is not detected
                motors[1].speed(-20) # Motor 1 backward
                motors[2].speed(60)  # Motor 2 forward
                time.sleep(0.01)

    def destroy():
        # Stop motors when Ctrl+C is pressed
        motors.stop()
        print("Motors stopped.")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        try:
            main()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            destroy()
